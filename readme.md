# BLACKJACK

## How To Play

You and the Dealer each start with $1000. Bet in increments of $25, $100, $500 per hand or go all in. The last player with money left wins. See it live [here](https://numie.github.io/Blackjack/).

## Technical Implementation

Blackjack is built is JavaScript and CSS. No external libraries or plugins are used.

## Features

### *All Aspects of Standard Blackjack Gameplay*
Hit, stand, split and double down. 8 decks, blackjack pays 3/2, double after split is allowed, split as many times as you like, and of course...dealer always stands on 17 (None of this hit on 17 nonsense!)

### *Basic Strategy Calculator*
If you're not sure what the right play is, ask!

### *Card Counter*
Uses the standard high-low counting system. Deck penetration is not taken into account (yet!) Cards 2 through 6 add to the count. Cards 10 through Ace reduce the count. A positive count is better for the player, while a negative count is better for the dealer.
